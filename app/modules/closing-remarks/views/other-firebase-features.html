  <p>Three-Way Form Binding with AngularJS</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can bind your model data to a FireBase location so that whenever your models change, those changes are automatically pushed to FireBase. Similarly, whenever the data at the particular FireBase location changes, your local scope model is also updated. And, since our view and scope model are already in sync thanks to AngularJS, this creates a three way data binding. </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Cloud Functions</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Write functions that can respond to events generated by Firebase and other Google Cloud services. These functions are managed within Google Cloud and scale automatically to support demand.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Firebase Cross Platform</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deliver cross-platform apps with APIs packaged into single SDKs for iOS, Android, JavaScript, C++, and Unity. Expand to a different platform without modifying your infrastructure</li>
    <li>Use the Admin SDK from your server environments in Java or NodeJS</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Send notification messages via the Admin SDK or via HTTP & XMPP APIs, meaning message may be generated from Cloud Functions or an App Server. Messages may be sent to topics, groups, or single devices, and messaging from devices back to your server is also supported. FCM is both reliable and battery-efficient.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Mobile Analytics</p>
  <ul>
    <li>At the heart of Firebase is Firebase Analytics, a free and unlimited analytics solution. See user behavior and measure attribution from a single dashboard. Supports iOS and Android, but can hybrid apps as well through the use of Cordova Plugins.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Crash Reporting</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crash Reporting creates detailed reports of the errors in your app. Errors are grouped into issuesbased on having similar stack traces, and triaged by the severity of impact on your users. In addition to automatic reports, you can log custom events to help capture the steps leading up to a crash. Supports iOS and Android.</li>
  </ul>
