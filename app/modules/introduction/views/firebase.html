<p>Firebase is a Google Platform as a Service (PaaS) which makes writing and deploying web and mobile applications faster and easier than ever. Now a front-end web developer can create fully-featured applications without needing to manage servers or infrastructure. In this workshop you will learn how easy it can be to take your app idea from concept to production, using the fully-featured Firebase platform.</p>

<p>Some of the key Firebase features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Web, Android, iOS support (as well as other languages)</li>
  <li>Cloud-hosted object database</li>
  <li>Real-time database (can easily achieve 3-way binding from Browser forms to Database and back)</li>
  <li>OAuth support - no more painful implementations, can add OAuth to your app in minutes</li>
  <li>Includes hosting for your static web application including CLI deploy</li>
  <li>Manage your entire Firebase account with their web console, CLI client, or REST API</li>
  <li>Complex security rules to provide object-level control over read/write/validation of your data</li>
  <li>Framework-specific APIs including AngularFire, ReactFire, and BackboneFire</li>
  <li>File storage w/ security rules</li>
  <li>Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform. Like Firebase Realtime Database, it keeps your data in sync across client apps through realtime listeners and offers offline support for mobile and web so you can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity. Cloud Firestore also offers seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud Platform products, including Cloud Functions.</li>
